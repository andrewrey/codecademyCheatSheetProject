# Cheat Sheet Codecademy Project

---

This project is part of Codecademy's Full-Stack Engineer career path. The goal was to create a cheat sheet a user could use while learning web development. I chose to create a cheat sheet that focuses on **HTML** and some of the more common tags. The layout of the table will be as follows:

| tag          | name     | description                                                    |
| :----------- | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------- |
| &lt;html&gt; | HTML Tag | root of the html document to specify that the document is html |

### technologies used

- HTML
- SASS
